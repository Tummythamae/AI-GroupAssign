**RSL Revenue Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Intent of the Project:**
This project's main objective is to create a reliable machine learning model that can forecast Revenue Services Lesotho's (RSL) revenue with accuracy based on given input features such as revenue category and year. Precise revenue predictions are crucial for optimizing financial planning and operational management for the business, which is crucial to the management and collection of national income. This project intends to develop a predictive model that improves revenue forecast accuracy by utilizing historical data, supporting strategic decision-making. Data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and deployment are all included in the project's extensive workflow. To guarantee the model's performance and dependability, sophisticated methods like managing missing data, encoding categorical variables, and systematic hyperparameter adjustment are used.

Furthermore, metrics such asÂ the mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared coefficient are used to assess the model's effectiveness. Feature importances are also examined in order to identify significant tax revenue predictors. Strategies for allocating resources and making decisions are influenced by the insights obtained from those inquiries.

Lastly, The model is trained on historical data and deployed using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. Users can input data through the GUI, and the model provides predictions for revenue values for the upcoming fiscal years (2022,2023 and 2024)
